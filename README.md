# Running tests in parallel using Selenium, Chai and Mochawesome #


In these automations with selenium I added 5 tasks in two files to run in parallel , make 5 assertions with .should() from the chai library, one being negative and finally I close the website. In the end I still use mochawesome to generate more detailed and intuitive reports.
