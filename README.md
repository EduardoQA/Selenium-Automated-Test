# Running tests in parallel using Selenium #


In these automations with selenium I added 5 tasks in two files to run in parallel , make 5 assertions with .should() from the chai library, one being negative and finally I close the website. In the end I still use mochawesome to generate more detailed and intuitive reports.




```
** Have mocha and mochawesome configured, chai and selenium webdriver installed in the archive folder. **
# Open the code in VS Code
# Open the terminal in the file folder and type node test.js

```
